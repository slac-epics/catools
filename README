This directory has been modified to support the W95 build.

Because the name conflict on PC W95, there is no difference
between the upper case and lower case, e.g., caGet and caget 
are same on W95, therefore the file name has been renamed
and reorganized in this directory. 

The caget.c and caput.c have been rewritten and moved to the 
epics/extensions/src/EzcaScan directory. The SDDS tools cavput.c,
cavget.c, cawait.c, pvMultList.c, pvMultList.h have been
moved to epics/extensions/src/oagca directory.

The caGet.c and caPut.c for array CA get or put on multiple 
PVs has been renamed to caGet1.c and caPut1.c in this directory. 

The caGet1 get all the values in DBR_STRING format and
caPut1 put the values in DBR_STRING format (as created
by caGet1 output). Note, the caGet1 and caPut1 does not support
waveform records.

They all use the share library now. Therefore in order to run
these tools the directory /usr/local/epics/extensions/lib/solaris 
must be included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
